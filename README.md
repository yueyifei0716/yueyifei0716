### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Yifei (Vincent) Yue, a final-year undergraduate student at the [University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), Faculty of Engineering.

I am passionate about the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. In natural language processing, I am particularly interested in topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word embedding techniques. For computer vision, I have a strong interest in image segmentation, image classification, and face and gesture recognition. My enthusiasm for these research areas stems from my desire to explore and understand the capabilities of machine intelligence in processing and interpreting complex data, as well as their potential applications in various fields.
